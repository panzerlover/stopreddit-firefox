    "description": "Ultralight app to stop you from scrolling reddit endlessly! Displays a modal overtop of reddit once you scroll down a specified number of posts, preventing you from clicking on any more posts and mostly obscuring your view. Scroll back up to disable. Number of posts defaults to 100 but can be set to any number. Works with old and new reddit.\n Only looks at the number of posts, no sneaky backdoor reading of your data in any way",
